            2020 has been a challenging year with the current global health pandemic. Besides our usual comprehensive assessment of developments in the electricity and gas sectors and progress towards the completion of Europe’s internal
energy market (IEM), this year in our Market Monitoring Report (MMR) we therefore also provide insights on the impact
of the COVID-19 on Europe’s energy markets. 
<br> <br>

Keeping the lights on and energy markets functioning is the normal job of the energy regulator. At no time is this role
more important than during a global health crisis. Keeping the lights on and hospitals equipment running saves lives.
Guaranteeing essential services such as gas, heat and power for household appliances and devices such as laptops
enables people to work from home.
<br><br>
Despite the crisis, the electricity and gas market integration process did not stall. This is good news. It also speaks of
the value of having integrated well-functioning energy markets

          <p>
            Since 2012, the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of
            Energy Regulators (ACER) has presented the results of its
            monitoring activities in the annual Market Monitoring Reports
            (MMRs). These reports are produced and published in cooperation
            with the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER).
            <br /><br />
            The 2019 MMR consists of three volumes, respectively on the
            Electricity Wholesale Market, the Gas Wholesale Market and Energy
            Retail and Consumer Protection. The MMR covers EU Member States
            and, for some topics, Norway, Switzerland and the Energy Community
            (EnC) Contracting Parties (CPs). This snapshot provides an
            overview of the highlights of the MMR covering 2019, with some
            additions looking into effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the
            first part of 2020.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 covid-upper">
          <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has, among its many impacts on society,
            resulted in lower levels of economic output with adverse effects
            on the income of many citizens of the EU. In response, national
            energy regulatory authorities are imposing a range of additional
            measures to protect energy consumers from disconnection of their
            energy supply.
            <br /><br />
            The pandemic has also resulted in an unprecedented negative demand
            shock to electricity and gas markets in the EU. However, during
            this period, the EU internal markets for electricity and gas have
            continued to function and there have been no disruptions to
            cross-border energy flows or trade. <br /><br />
            In response to the economic shock caused by COVID-19, achieving a
            sustainable and resilient recovery will be a priority. In this
            context, a cost-efficient integration of the internal energy
            market supported by an exhaustive market monitoring becomes more
            relevant than ever. To that end, the policy targets set for the EU
            within the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package adopted in 2019
            remain key. These include a fully integrated internal energy
            market, security of supply, improved energy efficiency,
            innovation, and the development of new and renewable forms of
            energy to better align and integrate climate change mitigation
            goals into energy markets.

          <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has been having a significant impact on EU
            gas and electricity market demands, showing a 7% and 8% drop
            respectively. Nevertheless, market integration continued at pace,
            with continuous volumes traded in the first half of 2020
            increasing by more than 25% compared to the same period of 2019.
            The same goes for gas hub trading activity, which rose by more
            than a fifth up to June 2020 compared to the same period last
            year.

              <div class="answer">
                The electricity generated at a power plant is frequently
                bought and sold a number of times in the wholesale market
                before reaching the final consumer.
                <br /><br />
                These sales generally take place in large quantities of
                electricity and involve energy producers, retailers,
                investment banks, and large energy users. Natural gas is
                traded in a similar manner. Currently, several hundred
                companies are involved in wholesale electricity and gas
                trading in Europe and more than 10,000 transactions take place
                every day.
                <br /><br />
                Wholesale prices are highly sensitive to available production
                and transmission capabilities because energy must be produced
                when needed and cannot be stored on an industrial scale.
                Prices may also be influenced by false information on the
                availability of these capabilities, or by reducing the
                production.
                <br /><br />
                Since plenty of energy is also traded across borders, it has
                traditionally been difficult to detect this kind of price
                manipulation as national regulators have not had access to
                cross-border data.

                <br /><br />
                <strong>ACER's role</strong>
                <br /><br />

                ACER is responsible for the independent monitoring of all
                wholesale energy trades. If market abuse is suspected, ACER
                will request that national regulators investigate. It will
                also coordinate cross-border investigations.

                Electricity wholesale markets continue to integrate in the EU as
                price convergence increased and the available cross-border
                capacity was used more efficiently in 2019. However, some
                significant challenges remain: the available cross-border capacity
                is insufficient and a more coordinated approach to ensure security
                of supply is needed.

            <p>
              The efforts of Member States towards market integration in
              recent years continued to bear fruit in 2019. For example, due
              to market coupling, the integration of day-ahead markets, which
              are the main reference for trading electricity close to real
              time, progressed significantly over the last decade.
              Consequently, the level of efficiency in the use of cross-zonal
              capacity (88%) in day-ahead markets was the highest across all
              short-term timeframes in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to EU markets integration, the amount of energy exchanged across borders 
              in intraday markets, which are key to facilitate the integration of renewables, remained at higher levels than pre-COVID.

                needs in a coordinated manner with a view to maintaining the
                desired security of supply levels at the lowest possible cost
                for end-consumers. In particular, the Clean Energy Package
                requires a thorough assessment of the adequacy needs in light of
                the resources available within and beyond one’s jurisdiction,
                meaning by having access to resources in neighbouring Member
                States, the overall cost of ensuring sufficient resources will
                be lower. ACER plays a crucial role in this respect, as it will
                approve the methodologies underlying this assessment and it will
                monitor their proper implementation.

            Gas markets in West Europe and parts of Central Europe, which
            account for three-quarters of EU gas consumption, have become
            strongly integrated since the process of establishing an EU

            <div class="answer">
              A fully functioning and interconnected internal energy market is crucial for maintaining security of
              energy supply, increasing competitiveness and ensuring that all consumers can purchase energy at
              affordable prices.
              <br> <br>
              Europe's cross-border gas networks operate according to rules that regulate who can use them and under
              what conditions. To further advance interconnection and boost trade, the rules, which previously fell
              under national legislation, have progressed into EU-wide network codes and guidelines.
              <br /><br />
              Each year, the Commission draws up an 'annual priority list' of areas to be included in the development of
              network codes, with input from a public consultation. On the basis of this, as well as further input from
              the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Network of Transmission System
              Operators for Gas (ENTSOG), the Commission adopts proposals for network codes.
              <br> <br>
              To ensure coherence between the national and the EU level, a gas cross-border committee with specialists
              from national energy ministers reviews the proposals before the Commission adopts them, with approval from
              the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament.
              <br> <br>
              In addition, the network codes are being applied, step by step, in the Energy Community, an international
              organisation that brings together the EU and its neighbours to create an integrated pan-European energy
              market.
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Common, market-oriented rules governing access and operation of EU gas transportation systems – the gas network codes – have contributed to high levels of gas price integration between Member States, increased competition and helped boost liquidity of trading hubs over the period of the last five years.
            <br><br>
            To facilitate market access and competition, the Capacity Allocation Mechanism Network Codes (CAM NC) enables market
            participants to book cross-border transportation capacity more efficiently and transparently. As a result,
            cross-border interconnectors are being used with increasing efficiency.
            <br> <br> While most long-term capacity contracts currently in place still precede the entering into force
            of the CAM NC, this will change in the coming years. More than half of contracted transportation capacity
            valid at the start of 2020 had been booked before 2015, but in the coming years, expiration of legacy
            long-term contracts will accelerate and they will almost completely disappear by 2035.

          Development of gas hubs keep progressing, but challenges
remain.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Trading activity at hubs continued to advance in 2019 and
has become central to most gas markets. 
TTF in the Netherlands and NBP in the UK have kept their place as the two most liquid and competitive trading hubs, accounting for the bulk of forward gas trading activity in the EU. 
            A level below are   other NWE’s, and some Mediterranean and CEE’s hubs where spot markets are liquid and competitive
            but forward liquidity is limited compared to TTF and NBP.
            <br> 
            <br>
           Various MSs, chiefly located in the CEE and SSE regions, still have weak or no hub dynamics. 
        Nevertheless, market integration is effective in areas
covering three-quarters of EU gas
consumption and advancing in the
others - for example, in this year’s assessment emerging hubs are joined by the Hungarian MGP.
<br><br>
A more complete realisation of the
Internal Gas Market can still bring
tangible benefits in the order of 3
billion euro just looking at price
differences in those MSs where the hub
model is functioning less well.

            New supply of renewable or decarbonised gas could contribute decisively to the EU climate strategy, with the added benefit of further rebalancing the current market power asymmetry between European gas buyers and third-country suppliers.
            </h5>
            <p>
              While EU green gas production has risen 91% from 2010 - 2018, it is still equivalent to only 4% of total gas consumption,
              illustrating that low carbon gas is not competitive yet compared to
natural gas. ACER has developed rules aiming at decarbonising the gas sector for it to be
built on the current successful market design, including, but not limited to, promoting the use of market mechanisms to incorporate new
technologies/ developments to protect
consumers from excessive cost burden, monitor and address any market
fragmentations and aiming to be technology-neutral to ensure a level
playing field.

              <p>
                Retail energy prices continue to vary across the Member States
                signalling that some markets are not operating at an efficient
                level. Energy prices increased in 2019 while price intervention
                continues in Member States. Such intervention is hampering the
                entry of new suppliers offering wider consumer choice. Smart meter
                rollout is key to ensuring consumers are provided clear and real
                time information regarding their energy use. However, the rollout
                of smart meters continues to vary across Member States limiting
                the provision of real time information to energy consumers.

            Link between wholesale and retail prices
          </h5>
          <p class="sector-subtitle-desc">
            The difference between wholesale energy prices and retail energy
            prices (mark-up) widened in 2019, highlighting barriers in the
            retail market. Strong correlation between retail and
            wholesale energy prices is observed when wholesale energy prices
            increase, while weaker links are observed with regard to the rate
            of reduction of retail prices following a fall in wholesale energy
            prices.
            <br> <br>
            The adjacent charts illustrate the responsiveness of the energy component of retail prices to changes in wholesale prices and evaluation of mark-ups in household markets from 2008 to 2019 for electricity and from 2012 to 2019 in gas (euros/MWh).

          <p class="sector-subtitle-desc">
            On average, end-user prices saw a small increase compared to 2018,
            albeit with large price variations across the EU.
            <br />
            <br />
            Household gas consumers in Sweden paid 11.8 euro cents/kWh in 2019,
            which was almost three times the price paid by household gas
            consumers in Romania in 2019 (3.4 euro cents/kWh). In the industrial
            market, gas consumers in Denmark paid almost three times (6.0 euro
            cents/kWh) the price paid by gas consumers in France (2.1 euro
            cents/kWh).
            <br />
            <br />
            Large differences in electricity prices continue for household and
            industrial consumers across the EU, Norway and the EnC CPs, ranging
            from 29.8 euro cents/kWh in Germany to 9.8 euro cents/kWh in
            Bulgaria. Even greater variations were recorded in the industrial
            market, with industrial electricity consumers in Denmark paying
            22.2 euro cents/kWh in 2019 or more than four times more than the
            electricity price paid by industrial consumers in Luxembourg in 2019
            (the cheapest at a price of 4.9 euro cents/kWh).

            Building Europe’s green recovery and the role of market monitoring  
          </h5>
          <p>
            In a post-COVID-19 era, achieving a sustainable and resilient recovery will be a priority. In this context, cost-efficient
            integration of the internal energy market supported by extensive market monitoring becomes more relevant than ever.
            Market monitoring captures the status of energy markets and identifies remaining barriers to EU market integration. In
            particular, the integration of power markets and the decarbonisation of gas are critical to meet the ambitious energy and
            climate policy targets set for Europe. In our view, the Green Deal is an opportunity to integrate sustainability objectives
            into Europe’s plans to economic recovery.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tackling climate change will involve a profound transformation of our economy and will significantly influence the way
            we use and interact with energy in our everyday life. For the energy transition to be successful, consumers will need to
            be informed, supported and nudged throughout this transformation. Our market monitoring underlines the importance
            of ensuring that consumers have ample choice and that their rights are adequately protected, not least the more vulnerable consumer segments. This requires well-functioning retail markets. We are committed to continue monitoring
            progress towards the completion of a well-functioning internal energy market and to maintain the stability of the energy
            system as a whole during and after this time of crisis.
