          <p>
            Since 2012, the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of
            Energy Regulators (ACER) has presented the results of its
            monitoring activities in the annual Market Monitoring Reports
            (MMRs). These reports are produced and published in cooperation
            with the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER).
            <br /><br />
            The 2019 MMR consists of three volumes, respectively on the
            Electricity Wholesale Market, the Gas Wholesale Market and Energy
            Retail and Consumer Protection. The MMR covers EU Member States
            and, for some topics, Norway, Switzerland and the Energy Community
            (EnC) Contracting Parties (CPs). This snapshot provides an
            overview of the highlights of the MMR covering 2019, with some
            additions looking into effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the
            first part of 2020.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 covid-upper">
          <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has, among its many impacts on society,
            resulted in lower levels of economic output with adverse effects
            on the income of many citizens of the EU. In response, national
            energy regulatory authorities are imposing a range of additional
            measures to protect energy consumers from disconnection of their
            energy supply.
            <br /><br />
            The pandemic has also resulted in an unprecedented negative demand
            shock to electricity and gas markets in the EU. However, during
            this period, the EU internal markets for electricity and gas have
            continued to function and there have been no disruptions to
            cross-border energy flows or trade. <br /><br />
            In response to the economic shock caused by COVID-19, achieving a
            sustainable and resilient recovery will be a priority. In this
            context, a cost-efficient integration of the internal energy
            market supported by an exhaustive market monitoring becomes more
            relevant than ever. To that end, the policy targets set for the EU
            within the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package adopted in 2019
            remain key. These include a fully integrated internal energy
            market, security of supply, improved energy efficiency,
            innovation, and the development of new and renewable forms of
            energy to better align and integrate climate change mitigation
            goals into energy markets.

                The electricity generated at a power plant is frequently
                bought and sold a number of times in the wholesale market
                before reaching the final consumer.
                <br /><br />
                These sales generally take place in large quantities of
                electricity and involve energy producers, retailers,
                investment banks, and large energy users. Natural gas is
                traded in a similar manner. Currently, several hundred
                companies are involved in wholesale electricity and gas
                trading in Europe and more than 10 000 transactions take place
                every day.
                <br /><br />
                Wholesale prices are highly sensitive to available production
                and transmission capabilities because energy must be produced
                when needed and cannot be stored on an industrial scale.
                Prices may also be influenced by false information on the
                availability of these capabilities, or by reducing the
                production.
                <br /><br />
                Since plenty of energy is also traded across borders, it has
                traditionally been difficult to detect this kind of price
                manipulation as national regulators have not had access to
                cross-border data.

                <strong>ACER's role</strong>
                <br /><br />

                ACER is responsible for the independent monitoring of all
                wholesale energy trades. If market abuse is suspected, ACER
                will request that national regulators investigate. It will
                also coordinate cross-border investigations.
              </div>
            </div>
          </h1>
          <p>
            Electricity wholesale markets continue to integrate in the EU as
            price convergence increased and the available cross-border
            capacity was used more efficiently in 2019. However, some
            significant challenges remain: the available cross-border capacity
            is insufficient and a more coordinated approach to ensure security
            of supply is needed.

              The efforts of Member States towards market integration in
              recent years continued to bear fruit in 2019. For example, due
              to market coupling, the integration of day-ahead markets, which
              are the main reference for trading electricity close to real
              time, progressed significantly over the last decade.
              Consequently, the level of efficiency in the use of cross-zonal
              capacity (88%) in day-ahead markets was the highest across all

              The Clean Energy Package aims at addressing the system adequacy

              desired security of supply levels at the lowest possible cost
              for end-consumers. In particular, the Clean Energy Package
              requires a thorough assessment of the adequacy needs in light of
              the resources available within and beyond one’s jurisdiction,
              meaning by having access to resources in neighbouring Member

        <p>
          Gas markets in West Europe and parts of Central Europe, which
          account for three-quarters of EU gas consumption, have become
          strongly integrated since the process of establishing an EU
          internal gas market started. The integration process is also
          gradually advancing in other parts of the EU but regional
          differences persist.

            The gas network codes bring more and more positive effects.

            <div class="answer">
              A fully functioning and interconnected internal energy market is crucial for maintaining security of
              energy supply, increasing competitiveness and ensuring that all consumers can purchase energy at
              affordable prices.
              <br> <br>
              Europe's cross-border gas networks operate according to rules that regulate who can use them and under
              what conditions. To further advance interconnection and boost trade, the rules, which previously fell
              under national legislation, have progressed into EU-wide network codes and guidelines.
              <br /><br />
              Each year, the Commission draws up an 'annual priority list' of areas to be included in the development of
              network codes, with input from a public consultation. On the basis of this, as well as further input from
              the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Network of Transmission System
              Operators for Gas (ENTSOG), the Commission adopts proposals for network codes.
              <br> <br>
              To ensure coherence between the national and the EU level, a gas cross-border committee with specialists
              from national energy ministers reviews the proposals before the Commission adopts them, with approval from
              the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament.
              <br> <br>
              In addition, the network codes are being applied, step by step, in the Energy Community, an international
              organisation that brings together the EU and its neighbours to create an integrated pan-European energy
              market.
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Common, market-oriented rules governing access and operation of EU gas transportation systems – the gas network codes – have contributed to high levels of gas price integration between Member States, increased competition and helped boost liquidity of trading hubs over the period of the last five years.
            <br><br>
            To facilitate market access and competition, the Capacity Allocation Mechanism (CAM) network code enables market
            participants to book cross-border transportation capacity more efficiently and transparently. As a result,
            cross-border interconnectors are being used with increasing efficiency.
            <br> <br> While most long-term capacity contracts currently in place still precede the entering into force
            of the CAM NC, this will change in the coming years. More than half of contracted transportation capacity
            valid at the start of 2020 had been booked before 2015, but in the coming years, expiration of legacy
            long-term contracts will accelerate and they will almost completely disappear by 2035

            <br />
            <br />
            Household gas consumers in Sweden paid 11.8 euro cents/kWh in 2019,
            which was almost three times the price paid by household gas
            consumers in Romania in 2019 (3.4 euro cents/kWh). In the industrial
            market, gas consumers in Denmark paid almost three times (6.0 euro

            cents/kWh).
            <br />
            <br />
            Large differences in electricity prices continue for household and
